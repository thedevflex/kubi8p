## 🚀 What is kubi8p?

`kubi8p` is the lightweight, zero-config installer for setting up **Kubi8al** in your Kubernetes cluster. It helps developers and teams bootstrap their platform quickly without writing YAML, managing tokens, or clicking through endless cloud UIs.

It works via a simple `kubectl apply` and provides a UI-driven onboarding experience where you can:

- Connect your GitHub organization
- Choose your repo(s) for deployments
- Configure preview environments (PR-based)
- Set up environment variables and secrets
- Store your platform configuration
- Deploy the full `kubi8al` stack inside your cluster

No Helm. No CRDs. Just Git, Pods, and Previews. ⚡️
